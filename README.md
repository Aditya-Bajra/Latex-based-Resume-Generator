# Latex-based Resume Generator

This repository contains a **Latex-based Resume Generator** that was originally created as part of the **[Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gen-ai-intensive-course-capstone-2025q1)**. Initially developed as a notebook for event submission, it has now been evolved into a fully functional **Streamlit app** to generate customizable resumes with a clean and professional layout using **LaTeX** templates.
